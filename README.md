4. Features
  Some information about the data:

  we are dealing with images(unstrcutured data) so its probably the best we use learning / transfer learning.
  There are 120 breeds of dogs( this means there are 120 different classes.)
  There are around 10000+ images in the training set(these images have labels).
  there are around 10000+ images in the test set( these images do not have labels because we want to preidct them).
